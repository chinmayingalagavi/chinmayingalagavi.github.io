bio_text: |
  I am a second-year PhD student in Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. I'm interested in growth, trade and spatial economics, microeconomic theory, and the design of institutions.
  
  I completed a BS (Research) in Mathematics from the Indian Institute of Science, and an MS in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics. I have been supported by the Fulcrum Fellowship, a regrant from the FTX Future Fund, the KVPY Fellowship from the Government of India, and the NTSE Scholarship from the Government of India.
